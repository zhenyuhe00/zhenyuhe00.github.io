# About me

I am a senior undergraduate student at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I'm interested in deep learning and its application to NLP, protein, drug, molecule and so on. I was a research intern at MSRA and DP Technology. Currently, I'm a remote research intern at Peking University.
